Subsequent to making a kindergarten mimic of Coroutines in Delphi - by making Conway's Game of Life with 2500 lambda functions - I've aimed to create the same thing, in Rust, using real coroutines.

Process of development :
- a small GUI grid, with cells that could be clicked on and off, and colours chosen
- an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, in Rust using lambda functions
- an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, in Rust moving step by step towards async closure coroutines

The entire effort has been enabled, at an experience level above and beyond all expectations, using Claude desktop app.
